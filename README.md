This **repository** is for the course project of MGT 4250 at Elon University.

## Project Description
### Questions of Interest
- Do cities/states with gentrified/poorer areas have a lower economic status compared to other cities?
- Does a specific sector of business affect the socioeconomic status and livability of a community?
- Does a certain race, population, or education attainment of the population indicate a certain socioeconomic status in the United States?

### Statements of Importance
These questions are *especially* **important** for understanding these visualizations because
1. This is important to know because big, metropolitan cities like New York City or Chicago have a high homeless population with little room for external housing and limited job opportunities for this population. It also causes extra resources to be diverted away from developing more career opportunities and infrastructure to facilitate better business and bring in more money for these areas. For example, “unsheltered homelessness is particularly high in California at about 68% compared to 24% of the rest of the nation” (Wurden, 2018). The US Interagency Council on Homelessness also says that”’homelessness is costly to society because people experiencing homelessness frequently require the most expensive publicly-funded services and institutions’” (Wurden, 2018). Homelessness, especially over the past couple of years, has become too rampant and being able to find the specific areas where it is the most rampant through Data Visualization will be able to address and find the most effective way to divert money and resources effectively.

2. This is important to know because some parts of the country are known for one or two industries they specialize in like Lafatyette, Louisiana, being known for extracting and selling oil. The type of industry in a city will also influence what people and businesses will be attracted to developing the city’s general economy. For example, the types of companies that will have the strongest impact on economic growth are high-value industries like “speciality manufacturing companies, consulting firms, and software businesses” (Endeavor Insight, 2019). These jobs could also be able to bring in revenue from other locations outside the main city and create more knowledge-intensive jobs. Another type of company cities should bring in are Entrepreneurial companies, since “businesses with local founders reinvest a greater share of their sales into the regions where they are based”, being able to create more jobs and grow the local economy as a result (Endeavor Insight, 2019). Examples of these places would include Silicon Valley in California, which has lots of tech companies and startups hosted like Google, AMD, Apple, Nvidia, HP, Meta, and the Research Triangle between Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill, North Carolina that is becoming the second Silicon Valley of the East Coast. This could be interesting to look towards within my research and data gathering process.

3. The third question is important answers an important point about how a community has grown and the economic status of it as well. For example, if a population from a gentrified area only has the education level up to a high school diploma, that would limit the job development for an area to lower paying and lower skill level jobs, meaning there is limited growth economically for that area. This would result in less housing development and less infrastructure for the area and a higher amount of people would be unemployed as well. I was able to incorporate the question and data into 3 Tableau visualizations that I feel are able to answer the questions I laid out.
